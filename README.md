# FamilyMap

The Family Map is a Java Android app I created to be used with the [Family Map Server](https://github.com/jasonccox/FamilyMapServer). I created this app for a university course project.

The app displays randomly generated family tree (persons and events) data on a map. It allows you to view the details of a person or event as well as adjust the filters/settings for what appears on the map and in the detail screens.

Check out the [specification](https://github.com/jasonccox/FamilyMap/blob/master/FamilyMapClientSpecification.pdf) for more information about how the app works.

**Note to future students:** Don't look through, or especially copy, my code if you're working on the same assignment. That would be cheating. I've made this code public in order to include it in a portfolio, not to provide you with a way to cheat.

## Installation

1. Download `app-release.apk` from `app/release`.
2. Install the downloaded file on an Android phone or emulator.
3. Follow the installation and usage instructions in the [Family Map Server README](https://github.com/jasonccox/FamilyMapServer/blob/master/README.md).
